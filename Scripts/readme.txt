THOUGHT MACHINE
Programming Test - Auction House
===========================================
Running:

- Both runauction.py and auctionclass.py should be in the same directory
- Run script runauction.py from commpand prompt/terminal with an input file 
  as a parameter.
    eg. c:\> python runauction.py input.txt

===========================================
Solution has been written in Python 3.7 and may not work on 
previous verions. It will be incompatible with python 2.x

Assumptions made: 
- Auctions may not have ended by the end of the input file and 
  will not be closed or printed
- Output is being printed, rather than stored in a file
